# Fully-Flexible-Slot-System-For-Shops

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:** 

In regard with the current pandemic situation we aim to design a slot system that would enable people to book their slots (each slot limited to a specific number of customers) and generate token numbers to refrain from social gathering .

We have considered a supermarket and assumed that there are different floors each dedicated to one specific item.

Eg: the first floor for grocery , second for clothes , third for accessories, fourth for daily essentials . We can restrict the number of people to 20(suppose) for each slot. Here we have restricted ourselves to 5 entries.
